            <h1 class="mainH1">Before we work together...</h1>
            <h2 class="mainH2">I am positive that at some point in your life you have been wrong. However, I don't want you to be wrong about us working together. So, let me tell you a few things about working with me.</h2>
            
            <h1 class="mainH1">1. I love going fast</h1>
            <h2 class="mainH2">I love getting projects done quickly. My philosophy is that projects should be released to users as quickly as possible so that we can know if a project is working or not. If you share that belief and want to build something that helps people quickly, I'm your guy.</h2>
            
            <h1 class="mainH1">2. I do real UX</h1>
            <h2 class="mainH2">Real UX means that I talk to users. If you are not talking to users, you are not doing UX. UX requires a designer to build a basic prototype and then test it with real people. I am not afraid of talking to strangers and learning what they want. In fact, I love it! Once we have an idea, we spend time talking about how we can make it beautiful. But not until we talk to users and learn if they will use it.</h2>
            
            <h1 class="mainH1">3. I sing around 300% more than the average human</h1>
            
            <h1 class="mainH1">4. I am extremly social</h1>
            <h2 class="mainH2">I thrive working in an enviornment that allows me to meet new people, understand their ideas, and learn from them. If your job requires me to work from home most of the time in isolation, the work I produce will be far below my potential. Plus I'll go crazy.</h2>
            
            <h2 class="mainH2">If you are still stoked to work, I cannot wait to chat! If not, I'm glad we cut this off before we both made each other miserable.</h2>

            <h2 class="mainh2 myDescription">I am positive that at some point in your life you have been wrong. However, I don't want you to be wrong about us working together. So, let me tell you a few things about working with me. <br><br> 1. I like to sing. I sing all the time. <br> 
            2. I hate going slow. If you are hiring me to do a job that is not really ready to go yet, please don't hire me. Really don't hire anyone. But please don't hire me. I will go crazy, and I will probably make you crazy too. <br>
            3. I LOVE going fast. If you have a problem that needs to get done soon and you have a lot of unknowns. I am your guy. <br>
            4. I am not a developer. I am quite good at HTML, CSS and Javascript but I cannot make an app on my own. 
            <br> 
            5. I do real UX Design. If you just want screens that look pretty for your app/website, I am not your guy. I love making beautiful things, but I first want to make sure we are making something that helps people. I do that through testing ideas with real users and getting their feedback. If you need someone to just designs screens, I can help you find them. But it is not going to be me.
